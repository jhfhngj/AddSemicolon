# AddSemicolon
Add semicolon



# What it does
I am a Python dev but I do sometimes do Arduino
projects. You may be too.

This project is a Python project where you set a file to add semicolons.

It outputs a txt, and after you changed the file type (.txt to .c, .ino, etc.), you get it! Saved time.
i'm lazy enough not to do semis
