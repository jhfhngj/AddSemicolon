# AddSemicolon
Add semicolon



# What it does
I am a Python dev but I do sometimes do Arduino
projects. You may be too.

This project is a Python project where you set a file to add semicolons.

It outputs a txt where you can add the tabs. Yes, it has a bug where it removes tabs. I might fix it lol

After you add the tabs you can make the TXT your specified file type and there, you saved time!
